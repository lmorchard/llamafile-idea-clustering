This is an exploration in using Llamafile to organize ideas

# Usage

Take a look at the scripts in `package.json` for how this thing runs locally.

In a nutshell, there's a small node.js server that runs as a proxy of a llamafile server. The node.js server hosts a static web page that uses the llamafile API.

Hopefully the startup process is as simple as this:

```sh
npm run setup
npm start
```
